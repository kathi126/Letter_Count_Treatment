# Letter Counting Task in oTree
 ## Treatment Group
This App allows you to create an Experiment with a Real Effort Task of Counting "a"s in a randomly generated string of characters of increasing length.

You can find the app for the control group here: https://github.com/kathi126/Letter_Count_Control

### Installation

1. In Terminal or PowerShell go to your oTree folder, for instance ```cd oTree```, and create the folder for the app with ```mkdir project_2_treat``` .
1. Make sure you have "numpy" installed with ```pip install numpy``` or ```pip3 install numpy``` if you use Python 3.
1. Define the App in settings.py with:

        'num_demo_participants': 5,
        'app_sequence': ['project_2_cont'],
    },
    # other session configs go here ...
  ]
~~~
